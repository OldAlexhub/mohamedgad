                  This analysis aims to determine the optimal car price based on
                  variables such as annual salary, credit card debt, and net
                  worth. It explores whether net worth is a valuable indicator
                  for assessing a suitable vehicle for an individual.
                  Additionally, the study considers gender differences to see if
                  they influence car purchasing decisions.

                  The article is structured to first give a thorough overview of
                  the company's operational and cultural framework by analyzing
                  its manpower. Subsequent sections employ various analytical
                  methodologies such as linear regression, logistic regression,
                  decision trees, and random forest models to investigate and
                  predict retention rates. Each model's effectiveness is
                  evaluated, and observations are meticulously noted.
